# Wind on Steel

To create an exact copy of my mother and her partner's Wind on Steel music website. She originally created her site using Wix (although the style and design is VERY dated!!!!). 

## Description

The main prupose of this project initially was to self-teach myself HTML, CSS, Javascipt prior to starting the COSC260 - Web Programming unit for my degree in 
the second half of 2021. Th eother benefit of recreating this website for my mum was so that she didn't have to rely on the restrictive nature of using online tools
such as WIX in terms of CSS and funcitonality and also to reduce hosting costs. The in intention is to host this via AWS and have any pushed Git updates automatically 
apply onto the AWS server.
